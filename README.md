## General Info
This project is make visualizations for the data from the NY Citi Bike website. The code used Pandas to format the data, and Tableau for all the visualization.  HTML with CSS and Bootstrap was used to make the web page. Data from June and July of 2018, 2019, and 2020 were used. Due to using the Public version of Tableau, there was a limit on how much data could be uploaded. June and July were selected as they are warmer months of the year, and there would likely be more activity to analyze. Three years were selected as 2020 is kind of an odd year due to the Covid-19 Coronavirus pandemic. There was interest in seeing how the 2020 data compared to 2019. 2018 was also used to make a better baseline for data when things are "normal." It was of great interest to see how the data might have changed with the pandemic during 2020.
